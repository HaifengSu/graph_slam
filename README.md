Graph SLAM: VO, IMU Preintegration, Plane, Line

## g2o  
**test_g2o_graph.cpp**: Implementation of visual SLAM based on g2o.   
frontend: VRO details in https://github.com/rising-turtle/visual_odometry   
backend: g2o optimization https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o

## gtsam
**test_gt_graph.cpp**: Implementation of visual SLAM based on gtsam  
**test_plane_check_vo.cpp**: check out distance of two measurements for the same plane
**test_vro_imu_graph.cpp**: Implementation of VIO+Plane SLAM   
**test_ba_imu_graph.cpp**: different from **test_vro_imu_graph.cpp** generate matches using bundle adjustment 
details explained in paper
